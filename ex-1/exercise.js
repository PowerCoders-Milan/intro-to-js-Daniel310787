/*
Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.

Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids." where the variables contain text of your choosing.

Output the same text to the console. Hint --> console.log

var numOfChild = 3;
var partName = "Ashley";
var geoLoc = "Paris";
var jobTitle = "Senior Web Developer"

console.log("You will be a " +jobTitle+ " in " +geoLoc+ ", and married to" +partName+ " with " +numOfChild+".")
window.alert("You will be a " +jobTitle+ " in " +geoLoc+ ", and married to" +partName+ " with " +numOfChild+".");
